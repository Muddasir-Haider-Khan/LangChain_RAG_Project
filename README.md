# LangChain RAG Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of LangChain for building applications powered by language models. It showcases how to integrate core components such as LLMs, Chains, and Prompts to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides context-aware responses based on user queries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- LangChain library
- OpenAI or any other supported LLM API key
- Pinecone API key for vector storage

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai pinecone-client pypdf tqdm

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:```
   jupyter notebook LangChain_RAG_Project.ipynb
   
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:- Set up the language model and API keys.
   - Upload and process text documents.
   - Define a retrieval QA chain.
   - Execute the cells to see the RAG system in action.

## Key Features

- Introduction to LangChain's core components for RAG.
- Example of integrating LLMs with document retrieval and embeddings.
- Hands-on experience with building a conversational AI system.

## Customization

- Modify the document processing and prompt templates to create different conversational flows.
- Use alternative LLM providers supported by LangChain.
- Adjust the vector storage settings to optimize performance.
