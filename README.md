# LangChain RAG Project

## Project Overview
The LangChain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project serves as a practical introduction to utilizing the LangChain framework for developing applications powered by language models. This project illustrates how to effectively integrate core components such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Chains, and Prompts to build a sophisticated conversational AI system that generates context-aware responses based on user queries.

## Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- LangChain library
- An API key for OpenAI or any other supported LLM provider
- A Pinecone API key for vector storage capabilities

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai pinecone-client pypdf tqdm

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project:
 ```
   jupyter notebook LangChain_RAG_Project.ipynb
```
3. Follow the detailed instructions provided in the notebook to:- Configure the language model and set up your API keys.
   - Upload and process text documents for retrieval.
   - Define a retrieval QA chain to facilitate user interactions.
   - Execute the notebook cells to observe the RAG system in action.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive introduction to LangChain's core components for building RAG applications.
- Demonstration of integrating LLMs with document retrieval and embeddings for enhanced context.
- Hands-on experience in creating a conversational AI system that responds intelligently to user queries.

## Customization

- Tailor the document processing and prompt templates to design unique conversational flows.
- Explore alternative LLM providers supported by LangChain to suit your specific needs.
- Adjust vector storage configurations to optimize performance and retrieval accuracy.
