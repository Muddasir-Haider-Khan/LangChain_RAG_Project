# LangChain RAG Project

## Overview
The LangChain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Project leverages large language models (LLMs) to build advanced applications. It integrates text processing, embedding generation, and retrieval functionalities, making it ideal for tasks like text generation, chatbots, and data analysis. This project serves as a comprehensive toolkit for developers looking to harness the power of AI in their applications.

## Key Features
- **Dependency Installation:** Installs essential libraries such as `langchain`, `pypdf`, and `tqdm` to create a robust development environment.
- **Google API Integration:** Utilizes Googleâ€™s Generative AI models for chat and embedding tasks, enhancing the capabilities of the application.
- **Document Handling:** Supports uploading and processing of text documents, splitting them into manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for better context handling.
- **Vector Storage:** Employs Pinecone for managing embeddings, enabling efficient and scalable information retrieval based on user queries.
- **Retrieval QA Chain:** Implements a Retrieval QA chain that allows users to query the system for contextually relevant answers derived from the processed documents.
- **User -Friendly Interface:** Designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily upload documents and interact with the model without extensive technical knowledge.

## Usage
1. **Install Dependencies:** Run the installation commands to set up the required libraries.
2. **Upload Documents:** Use the provided functionality to upload your text documents.
3. **Query the Model:** Interact with the system by querying for insights based on the uploaded documents.

### Example Workflow
1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   !pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain-text-splitters langchain-community langchain-google-genai langchain-pinecone pypdf tqdm

1. **Set Up Google API Key:** Ensure you have your Google API key set up in the environment.
2. **Upload Your Document:** Use the upload functionality to add your text files.
3. **Process and Query:** After processing, you can run queries to retrieve information from the documents.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
!pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain-text-splitters langchain-community langchain-google-genai langchain-pinecone pypdf tqdm
```
